Furrlo is a pioneering pet sitting application for iOS. It
connects pet owners and pet sitters to facilitate the animal care process
and to help hold the sitter more accountable. With Furrlo, pet owners can
focus on their travels with peace of mind knowing their furry friends are
being kept safe, healthy, and happy.
